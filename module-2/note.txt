* What we learn today ?
1. Arithmetic operator
2. Relational operator
3. Logical operator
4. How to conditinally work with those operator
5. learn conditional statement in c programming
6. if else, nested if else

* What is operator ?
ans: it is just a symbol, he placed between two values and 
    suggest some relation.

* ARITHMETIC OPERATOR - it sits between two varable,
    and return a value.
some operator - plus, minus, multiply, divide, mod - %

IMPORTANT: when we divide an integer by another integer,
    the result will be an integer.If we want to get float
    value, then on of those two number or both of them have 
    to be float number.

* Rules for getting a float value after dividing
1. one of them or both have to be a float value, 
    we can achive this by multipling one of them with 1.0
2. we have to get that value with a float variable, if we 
    take that value in an intger variable , then we can't
    get a float value

* RELATIONAL OPERATOR - it sits between two operator,
    and justify the relation and return true or false
1. less than -- <
2. greater than -- >
3. less than or equal -- <=
4. greater than or equal -- >=
5. equal -- ==
6. not equal -- !=

* LOGICAL OPERATOR - it sits between two conditions,
    and justify the relation and return true or false
1. logical AND - && - it returns true when both condition true
2. logical OR -  || - it returns true then on of them is true
