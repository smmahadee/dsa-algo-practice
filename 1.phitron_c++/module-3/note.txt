**-- class & object --**

* cin.getline() funtion take space and enter button as input.
* getChar() funtion takes a input but dont use that.

* "this" keyword is a pointer. it refer the object in which it stays.
* if we want to read a field of an object by "this". then, first we have dereference the value then read that field. ex: (*this).roll = 23; / this-> roll = 23;
