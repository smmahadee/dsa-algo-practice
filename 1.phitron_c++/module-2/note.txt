** there are two type of memory
1. stack ->  static memory/compiled time memory
2. heap -> dynamic memory

** difference
1. stack has limited memory but heap has more memory
2. stack can't increase his memory limit but heap can.
3. stack can clear automatically his memory but heap can't. we have to give instructions
to clear heap memory.

**-- create dynamic memory --**

* we can create dynamic memory by writing "new" keyword and datatype.
ex: int *p = new int;

* when we create dynamic memory by "new" keyword, it gives us a memory address from heap.
* we create dynamic memory by "new" keyword in heap, and we create static memory in stack to keep that dynamic memory address.
* when we want to set a pointer address to a variable, we have to set that variable as 
double pointer. ex: int *p = new int; int **q = &p;

**-- create/increase/delete dynamic array --**

* create dynamic array -  int * arr = new int[5];
* delete dynamic array - delete[] arr;
* increase dynamic array size - arr = new int[10];
