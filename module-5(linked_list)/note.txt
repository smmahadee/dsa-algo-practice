* data structure means - put data in a structured way. like we put money in moneybag.

** problem with array , why we use linked list **

1. Array is a sequential memory, so when we need big memory, we didn't get sequential memory.
2. We cann't increase or decrease size of an array, but we can in linked list.

** why we use dynamic Node class object , for linked list
1. because next time we need to create linked list in function, so when we return the function, that createed object also going to vanish, if we not create dynamic object.
