In terms of lexicographical order, when comparing strings using strcmp:

If the return value is less than 0, it means the first string is less than the second string.
If the return value is 0, it means the two strings are equal.
If the return value is greater than 0, it means the first string is greater than the second string.
So, in this case, "apple" is considered less than "banana" because 'a' comes before 'b' in the lexicographical order of characters. Therefore, you would say "apple" is less than "banana".
