** There are no format specifier in c++

** type casting
1. long long int -> int
2. character <-> int
3. float/double <-> int

** for changing long long int data type we have to write like this -
ex: (long long int)(a);

** difference between if-else and switch
1. when a condition matched , if/else break the statement,
    but switch execute all of the code below that condition.
