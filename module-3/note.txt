* What will we learn today ?
1. what is loop
2. when we will use loop
3. addition from 1 to N
4. how to use condition inside loop
5. Break, Continue statement
6. While loop, do while loop
7. how to handle infinity loop

* when we use loop ?
1. when we have to do same work mulitple time

* 3 types of loop in C
1. For loop
2. white loop
3. do while loop

* 3 Types of code inside loop first bracket
1. initialization code;
2. condition;
3. increment/decreament;
ex: for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)

* when we can use value in loop ?
1. that values have a start point
2. that values have an end point
3. there is a relation between stat point and end point

* CONTINIUE keyword
when the statement is matched, then Continue keyword
skip all of codes that is under this statement and 
go to the next loop.

* for loop and white loop are same -
but when we know about how many iteration we need, we use
for loop, but if we don't know about iteration then we 
use while loop.

* do while loop execute the code even the condition
doesn't match for the first time.then stop the loop.
