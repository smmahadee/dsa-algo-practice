** how to get a shortest path from a single source to specific node in graph ?(single source shortest path)

1. undirected/directed without weight -> BFS 
2. undirected/directed with weight -> Dijkstra
3. undirected/directed with negetive weight -> bellman ford -> O(v*e)

** how to get a shortest path from all sources to all nodes in graph ? (all pair shortes path)
1. floyd warshal - best O(v^3)
1. undirected/directed without weight -> BFS -> O(v^3)
2. undirected/directed with weight -> Dijkstra -> O(v^3logV)
3. undirected/directed with negetive weight -> bellman ford -> O(v^4)
