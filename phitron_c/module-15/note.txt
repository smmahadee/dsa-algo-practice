**-- pointers --**

** we can access an element of array in 4 way - 
1. arr[1]
2. 1[arr]
3. *(arr + 1);
4. *(1 + arr);

* when we pass the first address of an array, we have to pass also the size of the array.
* when we pass a string to a function, we don't need to pass the size of the string or length 
of that string , because string has a null character at the end. and strlen function count the 
before getting null.
