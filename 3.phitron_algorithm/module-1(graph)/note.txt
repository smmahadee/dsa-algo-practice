** Tree vs Graph

In Graph can be - 
1. multiple edge/line from one children to another
2. multiple way to traverse from parent to children
3. cycling possible between children.
4. edge direction can be both side ( top to botton and bottom to top)

** Types of Graphs
1. Undirected graph - it has no direction means it can go both side (top to bottom and bottom to top)
2. directed graph - at least one node has given direction (can be given one direction or both way direction).
3. weighted graph - its all node has a weight.
4. unweighted graph - its all node has same weight or undefined weight
5. cycle -  
    a. Undirected - it has at least 3 children and can be traverse from one node to everynode
    b. directed - their have to be a cycle to traverse in nodes direction
